**`Aspiring Software Engineer and Currently Student`**

Hello there! 👋 I'm an aspiring software engineer and currently honing my skills as a software engineering student at OntarioTech University. I'm very passionate about technology and I strive to create meaningful change. 

My interests include web development, full-stack development, and all things related to tech! I'm always eager to take on new challenges and learn about the latest industry trends. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good productivity book, or perhaps immersing myself into the world of vidoe games. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just chat about tech!

 <summary><h3>📙 My Journey</h3></summary>
Hello, fellow coders! 👋 My journey into the world of code began during my first year at OntarioTech University, in my "Intro to Programming" class. I was introduced to the fundamentals of programming through the C++ language and through the use of Visual Studio.

I still remember writing my first ever program:


```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Seeing my first "Hello, World!" pop into the console made me feel so much power and excitement, which led me to make a very significant decision - I shifted my specialization from Mechatronics Engineering to Software Engineering. It was a very difficult transition, but one that I am so happy I made. 

Since then, I've journeyed through the world of software development, constantly learning, growing, and coding.
